        <H1> About Me</H1>
        <p>
            Before going to the ROC Mondriaan, I went to school at the HML <br>
            Here I graduated from MAVO and went directly to ROC <br>
            I've wanted to be a programmer ever since I was 12, but my taste <br>
            in area has changed quite a lot. <br>
            I used to want to be a Game Developer, and then Web Designer <Br>
            My taste currently is at Cyber Security! <br>
            I live in The Hague, where I have lived for the past 13 years <br>
            along with my Mother, Father, Sister and dog. <br>
            I've been into playing video games ever since I was very little. <br>
            I could type my own name before I could speak full sentences! <br>
            My all time favorite video game has to be Minecraft, it was the first <br>
            video game I ever got! I must've put thousands of hours into that game! <br>
